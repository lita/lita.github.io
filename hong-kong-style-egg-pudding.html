traveling in Hong Kong last year. We ate it almost every day at the
Australian Milk Company while in Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>When we got back, we soon discovered that San Mateo had a restaurant
that had HK-style egg pudding!  It wasn't consistent. Sometimes, it
would be overcooked. However, the establishment did fulfill our cravings
for the delicious dessert.  </p>
<p>We ate at this place a lot. Like... a lot! However, each pudding was
$5! We ended up spending around $15-20 between the two of us, which
was painful on the wallet.  </p>
<p>I decided this was getting ridiculous and to try to make this dish
myself. However, I was being pretty cheap and picky about buying
ramekins needed to make this dessert. It took me a year before my
boyfriend found the cheapest ramekins at Daiso for $1.50!   </p>
<p>I ended up using this recipe as a base: <a href="http://www.tastehongkong.com/recipes/chinese-egg-pudding-my-organic-dessert/">Hong Kong Pudding Recipe</a>  </p>
<p>It turned out to be a success!!! I am super excited. Now, I will NEVER
pay $5+tax+tip for egg pudding EVER AGAIN!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Lita's Recipe for Hong Kong Style Egg Pudding</h2>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Two Eggs</li>
<li>1 cup of Milk </li>
<li>3 tablespoons of sugar (I used brown sugar)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tools</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Sieve  </li>
<li>2 individualize-size ramekins </li>
<li>Steamer</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the milk and sugar into a pot and heat the mixture till the
sugar is fully dissolved. I used medium heat. Be careful not to over
heat or the milk will curdle.     </p>
<p>In another bowl, beat the two eggs. Temper the egg with the milk mixture
you just made. (Basically add small doses of the milk mixture to the
eggs while beating so you don't end up cooking the eggs.) You can also
let the milk mixture cool and then add it to the eggs, but I was
impatient.   </p>
<p>Strain the mixture through the sieve to get rid of the foams.   </p>
<p>Place the mixture evenly in the ramekins.  </p>
<p>Place the ramekins in the steamer.  </p>
<p>Steam the mixture for 15-20 minutes at low heat. You kind of need to
experiment here, since the time is dependent on your stove. I basically
jiggled the ramekins till the mixture had a jelly-like consistency.   </p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the results! Next, I am going to try making a
Paleo-ish version with almond milk and honey.</p>
